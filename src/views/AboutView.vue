<p>Hi! I’m Shanna, a Singaporean in her early thirties.</p>
<p>First, I have to talk about the name of the blog, 
  which might have caused some confusion (and perhaps disappointment!). 
  This is not a blog on Korean dramas, although I’m happy to have a discussion on it! At some point, 
  I used to write quite a bit on Korean entertainment, but over the years, this has grown into a space 
  for me to talk about learning foreign languages, starting with Korean.</p>
<p>I’m born and raised in Singapore and hence grew up speaking both English and Mandarin Chinese. 
  I wasn’t really a language lover until I acted on a random decision to pick up Korean back in Jan 2008. 
  It was a life-changing decision. Foreign language learning has brought SO much to my life. Doing an internship in Seoul, 
  being a freelance translator, using it in my work and meeting so many like-minded friends are just a few examples!</p>
<p>Besides Korean, I’m also learning Japanese (since 2012) and started learning Thai in April 2020. In between, 
  I had dabbled a little in Russian and am also interested in Danish.</p>
<p>This is a space where I share my love for the languages I know (and learn), as well as tips / methods / resources for self-studying languages. Over the years, the language learning community has grown exponentially, and with the advent of technology (and also much more free resources online), self-studying languages doesn’t seem like a feat anymore, which I’m happy to see.</p>
